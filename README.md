# Competitive Programming 

## Introduction

I started competitive programming with C/C++ at the age of 15, beginning with basic programming fundamentals. Later, I developed a strong interest in Data Structures and Algorithms, which led me to create this repository to share my code with others who are interested in competitive programming. Feel free to point out any mistakes or suggest improvements!

**Note:** My code contains many custom `#define` macros for faster coding. To make my code more readable and understandable, please use [ALTHEA](https://nonbangkok.github.io/ALTHEA/) - a tool that helps convert competitive programming code into more readable format.
